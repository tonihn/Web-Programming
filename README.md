Some information about our project:

The project was about creating a game page with two games. First we built "Hangman" with the goal to guess the blank word as fast as possible. Then we built "Snake" with the goal to eat as many food pixels as possible before colliding with the wall or yourself while continously growing. While creating the two games we also included usable additions like a scoreboard (based on time or score) to allow competitive gameplay against you friends and pop-ups to enhance the user experience.

Antonia programmed the "Hangman". This includes the API for random words, as well as the hangman bars and the keyboard and everything else that goes with it (Javascript, CSS, HTML).
Ole made the homepage where the games can be accessed as well as the "Snake". Together we designed and created the scoreboard functionality for both games in a pair programming approach.
Ole also took care of the transpiling from TypeScript to JavaScript. This is done by using the "tsconfig.json" to compile the TypeScript files located in the "src"-folder into the JavaScript files located in the "dist"-folder (this is done by entering the "tsc" command into the terminal). This was added to benfit from the advantages of TypeScript and to reduce errors while simultaneously allowing the browser to execute the code without problems. Ole also created the scoreboard which saves entered data locally.
To also integrate responsive design, we customized the CSS files with media labels. We used pixelsizes for mobile devices (<480px), for tablets (<768px) and for desktop devices (>768px).

Antonia started the project with the hangman and the associated things and Ole then took her code and integrated his part into it.
It was only later that we uploaded things to GitHub, which is why all the files were uploaded by Ole. That's why Antonia's name appears very little or not at all in GitHub, but that doesn't mean she didn't do anything.

Some information about our project:

Antonia programmed the Hangman. This includes the API for random words, as well as the hangman bars and the keyboard and everything else that goes with it. (Javascript)
Ole made the homepage where the games can be accessed, as well as the CSS and the “translation” from JavaScript to TypeScript and everything else in TypeScript. Ole also made the scoreboard, where the times are saved locally and are therefore always available, unless you reset the scoreboard.

Antonia started the project with the hangman and the associated things and Ole then took her code and integrated his part into it.
It was only later that we uploaded things to GitHub, which is why all the files were uploaded by Ole. That's why Antonia's name appears very little or not at all in GitHub, but that doesn't mean she didn't do anything.


The project was about creating a game page with 1-2 games. So that there is not only the game, but you can also compete against each other, there is the scoreboard with the timer within the game. The difficulty was to link the different codes with each other, e.g. to get from the homepage to the new page with the game.


The project runs from the page: Homepage.html
